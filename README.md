# 💉 Vaccine Coverage Data Analysis  
### *A Data-Driven Investment in Maternal Health*  
**Author:** Amanpreet Bhogal

## Project Overview  

This project analyzes **vaccination coverage among pregnant women (CDC 2022)** to identify **states** and **racial/ethnic groups** with low coverage rates.  
The goal: guide **targeted public-health investments** promoting the *safety and protectiveness* of maternal vaccines.  

I built the database schema, designed an **ERD**, wrote analytical **SQL queries**, and summarized insights in a final **presentation** connecting data analytics to real-world impact.  

Data Source: https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data

## Database Design  

The raw CDC dataset (~2 000 rows) was cleaned, filtered, and **normalized** into six tables:

| Table | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| `vaccine_coverage` | Primary fact table containing estimated vaccination coverage (`estimate_percentage`) |
| `states` | State-level geographic identifiers |
| `survey_year` | Year of study or influenza season |
| `vaccine` | Vaccine type (Influenza, Tdap) |
| `age` | Age group of participants |
| `race_ethnicity` | Racial/ethnic classification of participants |

## Entity-Relationship Diagram  

![ERD](assets/vaccine_ERD.png)  

The ERD visualizes how `vaccine_coverage` connects to `states`, `survey_year`, `vaccine`, `age`, and `race_ethnicity` via foreign keys.

## SQL Analysis  

Each query addressed a distinct public-health question:

| Question | Key SQL Concept |
|:----------|:----------------|
| Which study had the smallest vaccine coverage? | `ORDER BY … LIMIT` |
| What is the overall average coverage? | `AVG()` aggregation |
| Which states fall below the national average? | `GROUP BY + HAVING` |
| Which racial/ethnic group has the lowest coverage? | `JOIN + GROUP BY` |
| How many studies covered Influenza vs Tdap? | `COUNT()` grouping |

 See all queries in [`vaccine_queries.sql`](queries/vaccine_queries.sql)

## Findings & Insights  

### 1. Racial / Ethnic Disparities  
- **Black, Non-Hispanic** pregnant women had the **lowest coverage (~19%)**  
- **White, Non-Hispanic** women had the **highest (~32%)**  
> *Investments should focus on addressing barriers and building trust in underserved populations.*

---

### 2. States Below National Average  
Overall average vaccine coverage: **63.95 %**  
States below this benchmark:  
**Oklahoma • New York • Wyoming • Maine • Alabama • Montana • New Mexico • Kentucky • North Dakota • Michigan**  
> *High-impact opportunities for targeted awareness and outreach.*

## Business Application  

This analysis supports **data-driven public-health investment** by pinpointing underserved demographics and regions.  
Insights can inform:  
- **Funding allocation** for outreach programs  
- **Education campaigns** emphasizing maternal vaccine safety**  
- **Community partnerships** to increase vaccine accessibility

## Tools & Technologies  

| Tool | Role |
|:-----|:-----|
| **DataGrip / MySQL** | Database creation, schema design, querying |
| **SQL** | Data wrangling, joins, aggregation, normalization |
| **Lucidchart** | ERD and schema visualization |
| **Canva** | Final business presentation design |
